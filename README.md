# ML Project
// to rename to: Pneumonia detection

Purpose:
- Distinguish between patients with pneumonia from those without using chest xray pictures
- There are 2 kinds of pneumonia, if present: bacterial and viral

Data set used:
- From Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Methods of exploration:
- CNN 
- logistic regression (pixel-wise)
- SVM (to distinguish between borderline cases of pneumonia)

to-do:
- data processing
- experiment with one of the methods above
- Performance evaluation

Logistic Regression:
- pictures have size 871 kb -> perform lasso regression to 

Milestones/Workflow:
1. Process images
