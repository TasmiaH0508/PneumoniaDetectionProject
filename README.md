# ML Project
// to rename to: Pneumonia detection

Purpose:
- Distinguish between patients with pneumonia from those without using chest xray pictures
- There are 2 kinds of pneumonia, if present: bacterial and viral

Data set used:
- https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dvntn9yhd2/1
- There are 1800 pneumonia samples in the training set (pick )
- There are 1802 normal samples in the training set

Methods of exploration:
- CNN
- logistic regression (pixel-wise) -> Neural Network and Normal...
- SVM (to distinguish between borderline cases of pneumonia)

to-do:
- experiment with one of the methods above
- Performance evaluation

Logistic Regression:
- neural net

Points to consider:
- using Google Colab

Milestones/Workflow:
1. Gain idea on how to Process images (complete) for Logistic Regression
2. Apply PCA to images to reduce dimensionality of data and repeat as above
